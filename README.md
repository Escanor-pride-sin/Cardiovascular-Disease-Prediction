# About The Project
This project analyzes cardiovascular disease data to identify key risk factors and predict the likelihood of disease onset using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains patient medical records including features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle indicators.

# The goals of this project are to:
Understand the key contributing factors to cardiovascular disease.
Build predictive models to classify disease presence.
Evaluate model performance and provide insights for healthcare applications.

# Dataset
The data used is from corizo, containing patient attributes and cardiovascular disease diagnosis labels. Data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering were done prior to modeling.

# Installation
To run this project locally, ensure you have Python and required libraries installed:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or install main dependencies individually (versions may vary):

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter notebook
Usage

# Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/Escanor-pride-sin/Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory.

Open the Jupyter notebook Cardiovascular Disease Analysis.ipynb and run the cells to explore data, train models, and visualize results.

# Project Structure
Cardiovascular Disease Analysis.ipynb — Main Jupyter notebook containing data exploration, modeling, and evaluation.
data/ — Folder containing raw and processed datasets (if applicable).
requirements.txt — Python dependencies for the project.

# Results & Evaluation
The notebook includes exploratory data analysis with visualizations, model training using classifiers such as logistic regression, and evaluation metrics including accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curves. The models demonstrated promising performance in predicting cardiovascular disease risk.

# Future Work
Incorporate more advanced algorithms like ensemble methods.
Perform deeper feature engineering.
Deploy the model via a web application for real-time predictions.
Expand dataset with more diverse patient records.
